- plot the RINEX ? 
- filter satellites we want
- then filter with time: take the closest time to the 
Time of week given (TOW): 225445.0 s, closest in the
past!
From this, we will get the correction terms. 
Run function [ephm info units] = getrinexephGal
then go to info variable to see which rows we should
look at to get the correction terms. 
- then create functions of slides 
Matlab functions can return several parameters

ECI: the Earth is moving in this reference. So if we
display the motion of the satellites, it will be on
a place with a small drift at each ellipse. Bad co-
verage of the poles. 

ECEF: the Earth is fixed in this reference.
