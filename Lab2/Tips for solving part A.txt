-4 first satellites for xB, 1
-7 other satellite for xB, 1
Get them thanks to Bancroft

1) SV clock error dtk = rho*(tGPS, k - taui,k)
- calculate the corrected Pk = P' + c*dt
2) Calculate sat position 
sat coordinates xk for time tk which is = reception time
minus transmission time = tau = Pk/c
What we find is in ECEF
3) Then correct position,
P = P' + dt'*c
4) Correct SV position for the Earth rotation.
