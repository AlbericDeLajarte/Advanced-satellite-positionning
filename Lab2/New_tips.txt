- complex number: incorrect Lorentz product
- bancroft not related to travel time 
- 

1)first correct pseudoranges
2)than compute sat pos
3)than correct with travel time 0.072 -> inputs for firt iteration.
This gives first approximation of receiver 

4)Then geometric dist and sat pos -> travel time for each sat 
-> new set of satellite coordinates then second iteration


My questions: 
-methodology for getting the dtk? 
Si on utilise les éphémérides, pour quel temps regarder ? Closest to
the tow given? 

dtk : function of the travel time 
tx time - toe

dans la formule: time at the transmitter= time when sat sends signal
= tow - tau. Tau is travel time. First approx: P/c

In formula: the ti is the time of week
tow(225455) - tau 
-> first dtk. Can stop there! 
But what he suggests: this dtk is a time diff. use it again to find
a new dtk. Substract tow - tau(P'/c) - dtk -> new travel time tGPS
-> compute new dtk


To see if correct, plug 6 satellites, compute receiver coord function

26159727.5930285: pseudorange corrected for sat 2  
The difference when you rotate is 100m

15272297.1319803 -> first satellite (sat 2), coordinate X, without Earth rotation corr
